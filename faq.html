            <a name="1"><h4>1. What is the idea?</h4></a>
            <p>This is a way to expand the Minecraft community with a massive homepage full of content through small 100 pixel squares. All different types of webpages are welcome, whether it be people’s servers, youtube channels, mods, merchandise, or creations that they have made. I am sure people will come up with tons of creative things to put on here. The idea was originally taken from <a href=“milliondollarhomepage.com”>The Million Dollar Homepage</a>, and it looked like a great way to use an old idea in a new way.</p>
            <p>Everyone who has something to share is welcome to get as many pixels as they want. The pixels are only being sold in 10x10 squares (100 pixels), as any smaller dimensions would make the pixels too hard to click on, and would lack any meaningful content. After buying the pixels, you can link the pixels to any website / URL of your choosing, and fill the pixels with whatever type of content you would like (ad/picture/logo/words/etc.).</p>
            <p>The goal is to have this site running for as long as possible, using the money from the pixel purchases to pay for the server. It is guaranteed to last a minimum of 3 years, but the goal is to keep it up as long as possible, and hopefully forever, keeping everything the same.</p>

            <a name="2"><h4>2. Why should I buy pixels?</h4></a>
            <p>This offers a way to guerilla advertise your Minecraft content. There are thousands of posts a day on other websites, with your content being pushed to the bottom almost as soon as you put it up. If you do not get tons of views right away, then your content may be lost forever. This provides a way to keep your content visible for a long time, and also brings in a large amount of people who may not be looking at the website that you are posting your content on. Advertising here also allows you to make your content visible for a much longer period of time, as there is litrally no way that it can be dropped to the bottom, or lost from sight.</p>
